# Home Sales

# Project Overview
In this challenge, I used my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then I used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verify that the table has been uncached.

I completed my coding in Colab, utilized my instructor, chatgpt, and a private tutor while I was completing this assignment.
